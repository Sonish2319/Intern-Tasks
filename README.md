# Intern-Tasks

Task A

# Setup instruction

1. Clone the Repository
   => git clone <url>
   cd Task A

2. Run the Project
   => Open the index.html file in any browser.

# Technology Choices and Rationale

HTML5
For semantic structuring of content and better accessibility.

CSS3
Implemented backdrop-filter for the glassmorphism effect.
Used linear-gradient and shadows to enhance visual appeal.

JavaScript
Smooth scrolling and infinite loop logic handled with a concise and efficient script.
Event listeners ensure dynamic interactivity without additional frameworks.

# Known Limitations / Trade-Offs

No Responsive Layout

# Future Improvements

Responsive Design
Enhanced Interactivity

Task B

# Setup Instructions

1. Clone the Repository
   =>git clone <url>
   cd kanban(Task B)

2. Install Dependencies
   =>npm install

3. Start the Development Server
   =>npm start

# Technology Choices and Rationale

1. React
   React was chosen because it provides a component-based architecture that makes building interactive UIs like a Kanban board easy and maintainable.

2. React DnD (Drag and Drop)
   React DnD is a flexible library to handle drag-and-drop interactions in React applications. It's highly customizable and easy to integrate into React projects for creating sophisticated drag-and-drop interfaces.

3. Local Storage
   Local storage is used to persist the Kanban board data across page reloads. It allows the user's task data (columns and items) to be stored in their browser, ensuring that the boardâ€™s state is retained without needing a backend server.

# Known Limitations and Trade-offs

1. Local Storage Limitations
2. No Backend Integration
3. Accessibility Limitations

# Future Improvements

Backend Integration
User Authentication
Real-time Collaboration
Advanced Task Management Features
